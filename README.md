# DIGIT-CLASSICATION-

Handwritten Digit Classification using NumPy (From Scratch)

This project implements a fully connected neural network from scratch using only NumPy, without relying on any machine learning libraries such as TensorFlow or PyTorch.

The goal is to classify handwritten digits (0–9) from the MNIST dataset and to deeply understand how neural networks work internally.

🚀 Project Overview:

Dataset: MNIST handwritten digits

Input: 28×28 grayscale images (flattened to 784 features)

Output: Digit class (0–9)

Approach: Custom implementation of forward propagation, backpropagation, and gradient descent

This project focuses on learning and clarity, not library abstraction.
